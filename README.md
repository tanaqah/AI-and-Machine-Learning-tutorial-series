## What is Artificial Intelligence? (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is an area in Computer Science that focusses on the creation of machines that mimic or copy the ways in which humans think and act. Some of the characteristics of such machines include Learning, Forecasting, Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis. [Sophia robot](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/) is a good example. 
## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the creation of computer programs that possess an ability to process data for example images and learn from it. Such programs can also learn through experiences to improve themselves for example a simple conversation with a human being.
## Principles of AI
### Ethics
1. AI systems should be fair and all the bias in any dataset should be disclosed and mitigated.
2. The people who develop and deploy the AI systems are the ones accountable for the systems and they should take measures to reduce all the risks that comes with AI systems.
3. All the effects that comes with AI systems should be thoroughly explained to the parties that are affected.
4. AI systems should be transparent such that all their failures can be easily traced and diagnosed. Also the algorithms and data used by the systems should be made known.
### Security
1. The security and safety of everyone affected by the AI systems is of great importance.
2. AI systems should be controllable and secure as long as they are operating that is decisions made by the systems should be overridden if necessary.
3. Privacy of user information should be considered when developing AI systems.
4. Measures should be taken to make sure that AI systems does not deceive or manipulate humans.
### Humanity
1. All the decisions made by the AI systems should be in line with human norms and values.
2. All the stakeholders of the AI systems should be a part of their development and governance.
3. All AI systems should serve humanity as a whole.
###  Inclusiveness
1. The effects brought about by AI systems should be beneficial to the society and the society should be completely aware of the systems.
2. AI systems should be inline with acceptable behavior in the societies and the human rights.
3. People should make the final decisions whilst AI systems play the assistant role.
## Fields of AI
### Natural Language Processing
AI systems are trained to read, decipher and understand the languages that human beings speak just the same way two humans would do. The image below illustrates how the Natural Language Processing occurs between a human being and an AI:

### Health
AI systems can be used to diagnose diseases, assist in drug development, personalised treatment and gene editing. This can be achieved by supplying knowledge bases that contain medical information that a doctor would know and then the AI system will use the data to make decisions made by the doctors.
### Computer Vision
AI systems are trained to identify objects and interpret the visual world just like the human eye does. Learning data is fed into the AI systems in form of images and videos and once the learning process is complete the AI systems will be able to recognize the objects from those videos and images.
